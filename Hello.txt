Hello, bajay!
i wanna say that ki,
sometime risauxu hai nw but 
tyo ni yetikai kam na bhaerw hainw k,
poila poila hainw, tei lay j garay ni matter hudai nw tho but
it is now dherai nai impact hunxa 
you know why?
cz i stated to feel deeply so every litte your's behavoir impact me
gari gari risauxu i know but something mero man ma xa ra tw risauxu ni
it doesn't mean ki tero galti nai bhaeye rw risako vanny rw
sometime it don't have a logic,
like sano sano kura ma risaune,
cz of your behavoir or how you treat me or the way you talk to me 
Sometime tero galti huda, even if you do somthing Galti
tero Galti vanda ni dherai matter tero behavoir lay garxa
i feel like, galti garay rw ni aaudai nw bolnw, fakaudai nw, maya gardai nw raixa vanny rw think hunxa 
jasto galti bhaeye ni aaerw samjau da, aaerw bolda 
if kei respons gari nw vanny ni still risairako ho k
then ask some question about another topic or do somthing then mero reply aauxa tw 
you should know about me ki, k garda xai bolxa vanny rw
feri it doesn't mean ki problem lai nai solve na garnu vanny rw,
after risako less bo vanny both of us need to solve that problem 
i know every thing about you but you don't know anything about me!
that's why i am tell to you, don't mine!

# most of boys hainw used to thik logically , like mero mero galti hai nw usko galti ho, i can't do anything vanny rw
#but girls haru xae emotionally think garxan , like hurt bako bela kinw sath ma hudai nw vanny rw
